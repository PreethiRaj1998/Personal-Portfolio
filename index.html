            <h3>Project 1: To-Do List</h3>
            <p>A simple yet powerful To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br/> This app allows users to add, save, and delete tasks, 
                ensuring they stay organized. It also utilizes local storage to preserve tasks even after refreshing the page. <br/>
                Features: <br/>
                ✅ Add Tasks – Easily add new tasks to the list. <br/>
                ✅ Save Tasks – Automatically saves tasks in local storage, so they don’t disappear after a page reload. <br/>
                ✅ Delete Tasks – Remove completed or unnecessary tasks with a single click. <br/>
                ✅ User-Friendly Interface – A clean and responsive design for easy task <br/>
                ✅ Persistent Storage – Uses local storage to keep tasks saved even after closing or refreshing the browser. <br/>
                Tech Stack:
                Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
                Storage: Local Storage for data persistence
                How It Works:
                Add a task by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
                View your saved tasks, which remain even after refreshing the page.
                Delete tasks individually when completed.
                This project helped me strengthen my JavaScript skills, understand DOM manipulation, and learn how to work with local storage efficiently.
